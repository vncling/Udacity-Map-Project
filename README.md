# Vincent's Yelp Map to find top rating restaurants

Just type in the name of the city such as 'New York City' the application will take you to the city and show you all the good restaurants show up on the same time. Also, you can filter them by point and click on dots on the map and system will let you view the information with rating information. of course, the system provides the link so that you can view more if you want to dig out more. Sounds cool!! Right?

## Getting Started

When user opened the app, the default place will be Orlando FL because this is my sweet home town and I am the developer so that I got the privilege to choose where it starts.   The user will only need to put the name of the city in the location field and either hit enter or “go” button. This will take you to the place that you want to be. One more thing bear in mind that it only works for the place that available in Yelp database so it has its limitations.

### Prerequisities

All the prerequisites are pre-install in the web page so that the user don’t need to do anything on there computer but a browser is a must and I will suggest updating the browser to the latest version. In case you are interested, I use couple library in this little program: oauth , sha1 (in order to get authentication from yelp api v2), JQuery 1.4.4, BootStrapt 3.3.6 (to make the site responsible for different kind of screen size), Google Map API, Knockout 3.4, JQuery autocomplete add-on. 


### Installing

You only Need a Browsewr like chrome or firefox, or IE but lated version preffered.
